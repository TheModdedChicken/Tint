# Tint
Tint is a Discord RPC manager for windows looking to create a modern, user friendly rich presence interface.

## Capabilities
Currently Tint is capable of Starting, Reloading, and Stopping instances of RPC, along with being able to create field profiles.

What are "Field Profiles" you may ask? Well field profiles allow you to store the data of your RPC connections to use later, so you
don't have to go through the hassle of filling in the RPC details you want everytime you launch the application.
(This isn't anything special but its a feature nontheless)

# Want an early build?
The most recent release was removed because of a major bug that stopped profiles from working.
I will be releasing a patch shortly though so look out for that.
~~Sure! You can find the latest build here:
https://github.com/TheModdedChicken/Tint/releases/tag/v0.0.1-beta.1~~

# What does everything mean?
(Tutorial Incomplete - I will update this with a tutorial later)
As of right now since I have not finished a tutorial on creating and using custom Rich Presences,
I will assume if you decide to download this you know how to create a Discord application and are able to find its Client ID.
