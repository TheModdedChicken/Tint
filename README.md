# Tint
Tint is a Discord RPC manager for windows looking to create a modern, user friendly rich presence interface.

## Capabilities
Currently Tint is capable of Starting, Reloading, and Stopping instances of RPC, along with being able to create field profiles.

What are "Field Profiles" you may ask? Well field profiles allow you to store the data of your RPC connections to use later, so you
don't have to go through the hassle of filling in the RPC details you want everytime you launch the application.
(This isn't anything special but its a feature nontheless)

**Usable Fields**:
- Client ID
- Detail
- State
- Small Image Key
- Large Image Key
- Small Image Text
- Large Image Text
